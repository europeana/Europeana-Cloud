Europeana Cloud
======

Europeana Cloud is a Best Practice Network, coordinated by [The European Library](http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/), designed to establish a cloud-based system for Europeana and its aggregators.

Lasting from 2013 to 2015, Europeana Cloud will provide new content, new metadata, a new linked storage system, new tools and services for researchers and a new platform - Europeana Research. Content providers and aggregators across the European information landscape urgently need a cheaper, more sustainable infrastructure that is capable of storing both metadata and content.
