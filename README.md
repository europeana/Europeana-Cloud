Europeana Cloud
======

Europeana Cloud is a Best Practice Network, coordinated by [The European Library](http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/), designed to establish a cloud-based system for Europeana and its aggregators.

Lasting from 2013 to 2015, Europeana Cloud will provide new content, new metadata, a new linked storage system, new tools and services for researchers and a new platform - Europeana Research. Content providers and aggregators across the European information landscape urgently need a cheaper, more sustainable infrastructure that is capable of storing both metadata and content.

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure of the project is developed jointly by [The Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center](http://www.man.poznan.pl/online/en/), [The European Library](http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/), and [The Europeana Foundation](http://www.europeana.eu/). 

Deliverable 2.2 of the project provides technical specification of the infrastructure along with the requirement gathering process. The recent version of the deliverable is available [here](http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D2.2%20Europeana%20Cloud%20Architectural%20Design.pdf).
